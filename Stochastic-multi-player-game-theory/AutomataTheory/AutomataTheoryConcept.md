# Automata Theory 

A branch of computer science that deals with designing abstract self-propelled computing devices 
that follow a predetermined sequence of operations automatically. 

An automaton with a finite number of states is called a *Finite Automaton*.
Automata comes from the Greek word αὐτόματα meaning "self-acting".



# Connection with Game Theory

The basic framework that extends *computational models* with concepts from game theory 
is the so-called **two-player zero-sum games** played on graphs.
