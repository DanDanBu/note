We require that the set C of colours the objectives refers to is finite

Reachability objective : The objective requires that a good colour is seen at least once.

Safety objective : The objective requires that only a good colours are seen.

Büchi objective : requires that a good colour is seen finitely often.

co-Büchi objective : the objective requires that from some point onwards only good colours are seen.

Parity objective: Is given by a priority function, {0 ... d}. The objective requires that the least priority that occurs infinitely
                  often is even.
                  
Streett objective : The objective requires that, for each of the pairs, if a colour on the left-hand side is seen infi nitely often, 
                  then so is a colour on the right-hand side of this pair.
                  
Rabin objective : The objective requires that for some pair a colour on the left-hand side is seen infinitely often while all 
                  colours on the right-hand side of this pair are seen only fi nitely often.
                  
Muller objective :  it requires that the set of colours seen infi nitely often equals one of these accepting sets.


Actually, we know that if we make an addition on players. 
What we sure is that we can discuss about objectives for SMGs to security issues.

We have Streett, Rabin, and Muller objectives to make our player decision more diversified.
