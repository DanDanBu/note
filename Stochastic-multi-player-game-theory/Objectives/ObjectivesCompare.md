# Basic Objectives in Multiplayer
  - Streett
  - Parity
  - Rabin
  - Muller
  - ω-regular
  
# Attributes
  - **ω-regular**
    We can correspond this objective to *Streett objective* as strong-fairness constraints.
    *Rabin objective* are their dual.
    
  - **Streett**
    Graph game for infinity strategies make objectives in pairs represent game participant behaviors.
  
  - **Parity**
    A complementation-closed subclass of Rabin and Streett objectives.
    

#Equilibrium strategies

  Now I’m finding what model can we proof that our Nash equilibrium is balance if the game extends to above three players.

  It seems Borel and omega-regular objectives are phenomenon about computer science and we can check out if it can be worked 
  on information security.

#ω-regular
  -*Turn-based vs. concurrent games*, depending on whether at a state of the game only a single player makes a move, 
   or players make moves simultaneously.
  -*Deterministic vs. stochastic*, depending on whether the transition function is a deterministic or a probabilistic 
   function over successor states.
  -*Zero-sum vs. non-zero-sum*, depending on whether the objectives of the players are strictly conflicting or not.
