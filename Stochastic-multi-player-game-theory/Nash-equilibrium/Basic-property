Nash eqilibrium is a basic important property of game theory.
While there's a game happen, every player will choose the best response in this game.

In a Nash equilibrium, no player can improve it's payoff by unilaterally switching to a different strategy.
In fact, to have a Nash equilibrium, it suffices that no player can gain from switching to a pure strategy.


What I'm going to figure out is that how can we find an equilibrium for multiplayer games.
It might be more higher complexity if conditions are less given.

Simply, we can talk about two players game first. 
In two players situation, Nash equilibrium is just a pair of optimal strategies.
