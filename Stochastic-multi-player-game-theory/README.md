# Stochastic-multi-player-game-theory

About game theory, we usually do some research on two-player-games.

In our lab, we put this economical theory to have some applications in Computer Science.

For the pass few years, I referenced lots of two player games on network security.

Now we try to figure out if we have more than three attackers, what situations will occur ?
